                        <h4>Local Storage</h4>
                        <p>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.</p>
                        <p>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.</p>
                        <p>The client  can only read local storage.</p>
                        <p>There is no transfer of data to the server.</p>
                        <p>There are fewer old browsers that support it.</p>

                        <h4>Session Storage</h4>
                        <p>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.</p>
                        <p>It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Global scope</h4>
                        <p>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</p>

                        <h4>Local Scope</h4>
                        <p>Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where itâ€™s declared.</p>

            <h2>3. What is js event loop?</h2>
            <p>An event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to execute a callback function after a given event has occurred. For example, when a user clicks a button on a web page, an event is generated and the event loop will execute the callback function associated with that event.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>4. How many types of undefined error we can find in js?</h2>
            <p>Undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.</p>
            <p>In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)</p>
            <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
